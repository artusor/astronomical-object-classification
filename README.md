# Astronomical Object Classification Using Different Methods and Data Types
###### Mar 2023
Project consisting of different classification methods for astronomical objects using different data types. First, classified stars, galaxies, and quasars with tabular data: preprocessed and analyzed the data and classes, analyzed and discussed features such as the importance of redshift in the classification of such objects, found the optimal neural network model given a specified set of hyperparameters (97% accuracy), and then used a random forest (98% accuracy). This can be found in `tabular-final.ipynb`. Second, classified 10 different classes of astronomical objects with image data: preprocessed, visualized, and analyzed the data and classes, followed the LeNet-5 architecture (73% accuracy), and then built a convolutional neural network (88% accuracy). This, on the other hand, can be found in `image-final.ipynb`.
